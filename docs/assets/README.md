The diagrams are generated by [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/).

The image [sidecar-all-panels](sidecar-all-panels.png) contains embeded metadata.
This means you can open Excalidraw, import the png file, and pickup editing the diagrams from there.

I exported all the individual diagrams from that single image for simplicity.
To edit individually use group/ungroup commands to move nested objects.
